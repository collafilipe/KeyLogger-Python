<h1>‚ùì Purpose of the project:</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        This keylogger project was developed primarily for academic purposes. Its main goal is to demonstrate the ability to create a functional keylogger using Python. The project serves as a practical example of how to capture keystrokes and manage the logging of user inputs.
        <br><br>
        The keylogger logs keyboard inputs into a file, sends the logs via email, and ensures persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. This project is an educational tool designed to showcase key programming concepts such as file handling, email communication, and system-level operations.
        <br><br>
        Please note that this project is intended solely for educational purposes and should not be used for any unethical activities. Understanding how such tools work can help in developing better security measures and awareness about software vulnerabilities.

    <h1>‚úîÔ∏è Features:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Keyboard Logging: Captures and logs all keystrokes into a file.</li>
        <li>Email Reporting: Sends the logged data via email at regular intervals.</li>
        <li>Automatic Startup: Copies itself to the Windows startup folder to ensure it runs on system boot.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>ü§ñ The Process:</h1>
    <p>
        During the development of this keylogger, several challenges were encountered, particularly in ensuring proper functionality and handling system-level operations. Navigating through these challenges required learning about various Python libraries and system commands.
        <br><br>
        The process involved setting up the keylogger to handle user inputs, manage file operations, and interact with email servers. Overcoming these obstacles was a valuable learning experience and provided insights into both programming and ethical considerations regarding software development.
